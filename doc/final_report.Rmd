### Geographic distribution of immigrant groups:
\
\
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Display map:

### Age, Year of entry and Age of arrival of different immigrant groups:

```{r, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Compute weighed densities of Age, Year of Entry, and Age at Entry for different immigrant groups. Weighing is done using survey weights PWGTP

select_countries = c('Mexico', 'China', 'Cuba', 'India', 'Germany') # top_countries$COB_name
plot_data = filter(db, NATIVITY==2 & COB_name %in% select_countries)

ages = integer()
yoes = integer()
aoas = integer()
age_freqs = numeric()
yoe_freqs = numeric()
aoa_freqs = numeric()
countries = character()


for(country in select_countries){
  plot_data_c = filter(plot_data, COB_name==country)
  
  # weighed density of ages
  dens_c = with(plot_data_c, density(AGEP, weights=PWGTP/sum(PWGTP), bw=4, n=100, from=0, to=100))
  ages = c(ages, dens_c[[1]])
  age_freqs = c(age_freqs, dens_c[[2]])
  
  # weighed density of year of entry
  dens_c = with(plot_data_c, density(YOEP, weights=PWGTP/sum(PWGTP), bw=3, n=100, from=1920, to=2020))
  yoes = c(yoes, dens_c[[1]])
  yoe_freqs = c(yoe_freqs, dens_c[[2]])
  
  # weighed density age at entry
  dens_c = with(plot_data_c, density(AGEP-(2014-YOEP), weights=PWGTP/sum(PWGTP), bw=3, n=100, from=-10, to=100))
  aoas = c(aoas, dens_c[[1]])
  aoa_freqs = c(aoa_freqs, dens_c[[2]])
  
  countries = c(countries, rep(country,100))
}

# data frame for plotting:
density_data = data.frame(age = ages, yoe = yoes, aoa = aoas, age_freq = age_freqs, 
                          yoe_freq = yoe_freqs, aoa_freq = aoa_freqs, country = countries)
```


We show the age distributions of five important immigrant groups: Mexico, China, Cuba, India and Germany. These densities were computed by weghing observations using the survey weights PWGTP.

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# age distributions:
ggplot(density_data, aes(age, age_freq, color=country)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title='Age distribution per immigrant group', x='Age', y='Frequency', color='Country') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,10))
```
\
We notice that German immigrants tend to be significantly older than other groups, with a most likely age of about 70 years old. Cuban foreign-born residents are the second oldest group, with a typical age of about 50. In constrast, the bulk of Mexican and Indian immigrants tends to be in their thirties. Interestingly, the Chinese foreign-born population appears to have a bimodal distribution, with most idividuals either in their mid-twenties or in their forties. \
These age differences might be explained by the year in which each group entered the United States. We look at this next.
\
\

 
```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# year of entry distributions:
ggplot(density_data, aes(yoe, yoe_freq, color=country)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title='Frequency of year of entry per immigrant group', x='Year of entry', y='Frequency', color='Country') +
  xlim(c(1920,2010)) +
  annotate("text", x=1957, y=0.027, label='Post-WWII') +
  annotate("text", x=1967, y=0.018, label='Cuban Rev.') 
```
\
As suggested by the age distributions, we see that the large majority of the German group arrived in the coutry the earliest, in the two decades following World War II. The Cuban group followed, most likely pushed to exile by the revolution of 1953-59. We also see that the Mexican wave of immigration seems to have peaked around 2000, whereas Chinese and Indian immigration appears to not yet have reached its peak.\
Finally, we look at the distribution of the age of arrival, computed by subtracting the years since arrival (2014 - year-of-entry) to the current age.
\
\


```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# age at entry distributions:
ggplot(density_data, aes(aoa, aoa_freq, color=country)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title='Distribution of age of arrival per immigrant group', x='Age of arrival', y='Frequency', color='Country') +
  xlim(c(0,75)) 
 
```
\
We see a general trend in most groups to immigrate to the country in their twenties. There is also evidence of a smaller mode at 0-10 years of age for most distributions, which suggests that a lot of foreign-born residents entered the country as small children.
\


  
### Now let's talk about education!
\
\
\
\

```{r echo = FALSE, message= FALSE}
db_native = filter(db, NATIVITY == 1)
db_foregin = filter(db, NATIVITY == 2)
db_foregin = mutate(db_foregin, Age_of_Entry = AGEP - (2014 - YOEP))

#break education level into groups
db_foregin = mutate(db_foregin, edu_level = cut(db_foregin$SCHL, breaks = c(1,3,7,11,16,21,24), labels = c('No school', 'Elementary school','Middle school','High school','College','Beyond'),include.lowest = T ))

db_native = mutate(db_native, edu_level = cut(db_native$SCHL, breaks = c(1,3,7,11,16,21,24), labels = c('No school', 'Elementary school','Middle school','High school','College','Beyond'),include.lowest = T ))

db_native = filter(db_native, !is.na(edu_level))
#showing the distribution of the education level of native Americans
ggplot(db_native, aes(edu_level)) + geom_bar(aes(weights = PWGTP/sum(PWGTP)), position = 'dodge') + scale_x_discrete() + 
  theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + labs(title = 'Native American', x = 'Education Level', y = 'Freq') 
```
\
\
\
So as we can see here,most of the native Americans have went to college or have an associate degree or other certifications. And people who have went to high school and college add up to around 70 percent of the population. So let's see what's the scenario for other countries.
\
\
```{r echo = FALSE}
#temporary dataset with only top 20 countries
top_db = filter(db_foregin, (COB_name %in% top_countries$COB_name) & !is.na(edu_level))

#store education level dist figure in a list
graph_list = list()

for (country in top_countries$COB_name){
  temp = filter(top_db, COB_name == country)
  graph_list[[country]] = ggplot(temp, aes(edu_level)) + geom_bar(aes(weights = PWGTP/sum(PWGTP)), position = 'dodge') + scale_x_discrete() + 
  theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + labs(title = country, x = 'Education Level', y = 'Freq') 
}

#png(filename = "../figs/Education_level.png")
#grid.arrange(graph_list$India, graph_list$China, graph_list$Korea,
#             graph_list$Guatemala, graph_list$Mexico, graph_list$`El Salvador`,
#             graph_list$Germany, graph_list$Haiti,graph_list$Poland,nrow = 3)
#dev.off()
#Have no idea why the F** it doesn't work in R Markdown
```

![](../figs/Education_level.png)
\
\
\
The graphs above are all from countries within our top 20 list. I've organized it a bit so that the first row is all Asian countries, and vast majority of Asian people in state posses a higher education degree, especially the percentage of people having a master or doctorate degree are around 20%, or even goes up to 40% like India, which is way higher than the native Americans. And as we see before, the era of Asian evasion has just began, a lot of well-educated Asian people are coming into US. We'll see a bit more later.
\
\
The second row is countries from America, the most common education background as we see in the graph is high school level. In the third row we got Germany and Poland from Europe, the distribution is kind of similar to Asian countries with most of the people in the college level, and a larger proportion of master and doctorate degrees.
